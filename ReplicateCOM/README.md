# üöÄ AI Model Deployment & MLOps ‚Äì Master Class Summary

This session introduces the key concepts, tools, and workflows needed to deploy machine learning models in real-world environments. It focuses on practical, scalable strategies from solo developer setups to enterprise-grade MLOps stacks.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand what it means to "deploy" a machine learning model
- Identify core components of a minimal deployment architecture
- Explore best practices in MLOps: model versioning, CI/CD, monitoring
- CI/CD = Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
- Learn how to scale from quick demos to production-grade services

---

## üß† What Is Deployment?

Model deployment is the process of taking a trained model and making it **accessible for real-time or batch inference** via APIs, apps, or pipelines.

A good deployment setup ensures:
- The model is versioned and traceable
- It can be served reliably and securely
- It can be monitored, updated, and improved

---

## üèóÔ∏è What Is MLOps?

MLOps is the **DevOps for machine learning**. It includes everything needed to:
- Train, track, and version models
- Automate deployment pipelines
- Monitor models in production
- Enable CI/CD for machine learning workflows

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è MLOps Lifecycle Overview

1. **Data Ingestion** ‚Äì pipelines for clean, repeatable data input
2. **Training & Tuning** ‚Äì experiment tracking, reproducibility
3. **Model Registry** ‚Äì store and manage versioned models
4. **Deployment** ‚Äì expose the model via APIs or batch jobs
5. **Monitoring & Retraining** ‚Äì feedback loops, drift detection

## üì∂ Deployment Stack Spectrum (From Lightweight to Enterprise)

| Tool / Platform     | Type                  | Ideal For                  | Pros                                             | Cons                                           |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Streamlit + FastAPI** | Local/lightweight stack | Solo dev, MVPs              | Simple, fast, flexible. Full control.            | Manual ops, no native scaling or versioning    |
| **Replicate.com**   | Serverless model API   | Public demos, fast API launch| No infra. Just push to GitHub. Scalable by default| Limited customization. Less control.           |
| **MLflow**          | Model tracking + serving| Teams, experiments          | Logs runs, versions models, serves endpoints     | Requires setup + infra, not a full platform    |
| **Docker + CI/CD**  | Portable containerization| App-like services          | Portable, repeatable, integrates with pipelines  | Requires DevOps and hosting                    |
| **Vertex AI / SageMaker** | Managed cloud MLOps | Full product teams          | Scalable, managed, secure. All-in-one MLOps.     | Expensive, vendor lock-in, complexity          |
| **Kubernetes**      | Container orchestration| Enterprise infrastructure    | Extreme scale, flexible routing, auto-scaling    | Steep learning curve, high complexity          |

## üß∞ Core Deployment Stack

| Layer            | Responsibility                   | Example Tools              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Model Serving**| Serve predictions via API         | FastAPI, TorchServe, Flask |
| **UI / Client**  | Collect user inputs, show results | Streamlit, Gradio          |
| **Hosting**      | Make app available over network   | Render, Railway, VPS       |
| **Monitoring**   | Track usage, performance          | Prometheus, Sentry         |
| **Security**     | Control access, prevent abuse     | API Keys, Auth, HTTPS      |

## üí° Deployment Patterns

| Scenario                      | Recommended Stack                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Solo Dev, MVP                 | FastAPI + Streamlit on Render     |
| Public Model API              | Replicate.com                     |
| Experiment Management         | MLflow + Docker + CI/CD           |
| Enterprise Production         | Kubernetes + SageMaker/Vertex AI  |
| Research Demos                | Hugging Face Spaces, Gradio       |

## üîê Common Deployment Pitfalls

- Hardcoding models without versioning
- Exposing endpoints without auth
- Not monitoring latency, throughput, or failure cases
- Forgetting to replicate preprocessing during inference
- Deploying too early without CI or rollback plan

---

## üî≠ Key Takeaways

- **You don‚Äôt need Kubernetes to get started.**
- Build a working pipeline with API + UI + Model first.
- Add MLOps (versioning, CI/CD, monitoring) as you scale.
- Use tools like Replicate.com for fast demos, and MLflow for deeper ops control.
